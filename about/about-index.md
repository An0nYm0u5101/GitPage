# berzerk0's About Me

Hello!

My name is Ben, I live in NYC, and I'd like to be a Penetration Tester.

This term is often interchangeable with "Ethical Hacker," but that's like saying "non-embezzling accountant." I prefer the term "Security Auditor."

I'm committed to keeping my hat white and helping people understand and mitigate real-world problems.


Security is a new field for me. I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering and have worked for two defense contractors and a San Francisco gadget startup.

It's fascinating how technology can start out as a flash of inspiration and end up impacting people's lives. But it's not without its risks, and it's important that we stay ahead of them as much as possible.


Check out my projects and writings linked at the top and bottom of this page. You can also find me on twitter at [@berzerk0](https://twitter.com/berzerk0).

Thanks for stopping by!
