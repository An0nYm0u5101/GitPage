## Projects and Tools

* [Probable Wordlists](https://github.com/berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists)  - Wordlists sorted by popularity. Make sure your passwords aren't popular! Completely overhauled version 2 released.

* [BEWGor](https://github.com/berzerk0/BEWGor) - Bull's Eye Wordlist Generator: Does your password rely on predictable patterns of accessible info?

* [@WorstPasswords](https://twitter.com/worstpasswords) - Twitter bot inspired by @redteamwrangler that tweets out one of the world's most common 747 passwords twice a day.



These projects have gained some attention and has been mentioned in articles, a podcast, and even a book! I'd like to return the favor.
Check out the [Shoutout Page](shoutouts.html) for the (incomplete) list of mentions!


* [RIGA-38-Hydrant](http://pasted.co/96db820a) - A cryptography, steganography, and OSINT CTF-Like group of challenges. 25 in all.  One day I will find a better home for these, but for now they are at pasted.co.
